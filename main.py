Do not show steps, no salutationâ€”strictly generate the report directly. You are a smart contract auditor. Generate a markdown report explaining every vulnerability in detail and in very simple language.
I have added the audit keyword in this Solidity file to indicate that the following lines of code are vulnerable and need to be fixed. Just make an audit report documentation in the following form: (like a smart contract auditor with an in-depth and detailed explanation of the vulnerability).
I explain the format and what each heading will contain in the report wherever required. Do not write the prompt in the report strictly.
- TITLE: Contain Root Cause + Impact
- Proof of Concept: Contain a function using Foundry that will exploit the specified vulnerability. Provide the Foundry command to run this function once I copy and execute it in Foundry. Provide end-to-end complete code for that exploit with no syntax errors. Add comments to explain the code.
- [[S]-#] means we have to determine the severity of the vulnerability based on Codehawks - How to evaluate a finding severity docs. Replace [S] with High, Medium, or Low based on the severity. For the Proof of Concept, add step-by-step code/commands in Foundry on how to test and prove the finding. Include exact lines of code and Foundry-based commands in(in sub-section under proof of concept) the Proof of Concept section.
- Whenever you reference a variable name or function name, use the format `SmartContractName::variableName`.
